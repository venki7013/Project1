            <p id="p1">The Indian cricket board (BCCI) was <span style="color: blue">heavily criticised</span> by traditional state associations which were not allotted matches during the ICC World Cup 2023, <span style="color: blue">the schedule</span> for which was announced in an ICC event in Mumbai on Tuesday. 10 venues - Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Dharamsala, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, and Pune - were announced to stage the 48 matches of the ODI World Cup to be played between October 5 and November 19. Trivandrum and Guwahati will host warm-up matches. Some of the centres that would feel they were done by are Mohali, Indore, Rajkot, Ranchi and Nagpur.</p>

            <p id="p3">Mohali, a stadium which has been hosting important World Cup matches since 1996, was the most surprising of the lot. Needless to say, the strongest reaction also came from that region. After Punjab Sports Minister Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer criticised BCCI for excluding Mohali as a venue for the World Cup, the board vice president Rajeev Shukla provided an explanation.

                <span style="color: red">"The exclusion of Punjab's Mohali from the list of host cities for the tournament was due to political interference. Punjab government will raise this issue with BCCI,"</span> Hayer had said.
                
                Shukla said that bilateral series matches will be given to Mohali and there will be no discrimination.
                
                ‘Current stadium in Mohali did not meet the standards of ICC and hence was denied matches’
                "Virat Kohli's 100th Test last year was given to Mohali. Mullanpur Stadium is getting ready in Mohali. Had it been ready, they would have got a World Cup match. The current stadium in Mohali did not meet the standards of ICC and hence was denied matches. But that does not matches would not be given to them. Bilateral series matches will be given to them, it is based on a rotational system. No 'pick and choose' has been done. ICC's consent is important in finalising the venues. In Trivandrum, warm-up matches have been given, for the first time. It is not that any centre/zone has been ignored. Stadiums have been chosen after a lot of consideration, even in North East Zone, Guwahati got the matches. A lot of accommodation has been done in the schedule," he told news agency ANI.</p>
